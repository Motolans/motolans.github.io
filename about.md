I help teams and audiences understand complex systems through stories, data, and interactive mechanics.

Over the past decade, I’ve translated messy, ambiguous data into audience-facing insights, produced analysis-driven reports for financial and business contexts, and guided interactive game projects where every design choice carried real consequences. Along the way, I’ve navigated both highly constrained SEO brief-driven formats and open-ended systems challenges — learning how to identify hidden risks and make decisions that matter.

Mostly, I turn complexity into clarity. If you want someone who can help build or add clarity to your systems, let's talk.

**Specialties:**

**Data & Analysis:** Python, R, SQL, spreadsheets

**Interactive Systems:** Game mechanics, level design

**Content & Communication:** Writing, editing, interviews
